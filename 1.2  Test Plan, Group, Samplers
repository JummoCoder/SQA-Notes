What is Test Plan?
---------
A Test Plan can be viewed as a container for running tests. It
defines what to test and how to go about it. A complete test
plan consists of one or more elements such as thread
groups, logic controllers, sample-generating controllers,
listeners, timers, assertions, and configuration elements. A
test plan must have at least one thread group.

What is Test Group?
--------
Thread Groups is a collection of Threads. Each thread represents one
user using the application under test. Basically, each Thread simulates
one real user request to the server. The controls for a thread group
allow you to Set the number of threads for each group.

Samplers?
--------
Samplers in JMeter are added as a child of Thread Groups. These are
used to send different types of requests to the server. Once, the
sampler request is processed by the server, its response is returned to
JMeter and the same can be viewed and analyzed in terms of different
performance parameters like response time, Hits per second,
throughput, etc.
Different Types of Samplers
Let’s now see the different types of Sampler provided by JMeter. Some
of the most widely used Sampler in JMeter is-
• HTTP Request – Used to send HTTP/HTTPS requests to server. This
is the most widely used sampler for testing Web-based applications.
• JDBC Request – Used to send SQL queries to a database server.
• SOAP/XML-RPC Request – Used to send SOAP requests to a SOAP
web service.
• Test Action – This is a special type of Sampler, which doesn’t send a
request to the server instead it is used to introduce pauses in a test.
• FTP Request – Used to send file put and get requests to an FTP
server.
